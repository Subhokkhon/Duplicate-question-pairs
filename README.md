Duplicate Question Pairs Detection
Project Description
This project is a web application that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to detect whether two questions are duplicates of each other. Users can enter any two questions, and the application will analyze them to determine if they convey the same meaning.

The app is built using Streamlit for an interactive web interface and employs NLP techniques to compare the semantic similarity of questions. If the questions are determined to be duplicates, the app returns "Duplicate", otherwise it returns "Not Duplicate".

Features
Accepts any two questions as input.

Uses NLP techniques to identify semantic similarity.

Returns a simple output: Duplicate or Not Duplicate.

Interactive web interface powered by Streamlit.

Technologies Used
Python

Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Streamlit

How It Works
Users input two questions.

The application processes the questions using NLP models.

The similarity between the two questions is calculated.

Based on the similarity score, the app classifies the questions as Duplicate or Not Duplicate.
